## Getting Started
Install the relevant dependencies with: 
1. `cd frontend/ && npm install` (assuming that you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)).
2. `cd ..`

Note: further information can be found in `./frontend/README.md` and `./backend/README.md`.

## Running the application
Execute the script which runs the tests with: `./script/run_tests.sh`

When the tests run successfully, another script will automatically be executed which launches the servers.

The application will then be available at: [http://localhost:4523/](localhost:4523)
